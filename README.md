# Ultrasonic-Obstacle-Avoidance-for-Autonomous-Robots
This repository contains the implementation of an autonomous robot navigation system with real-time obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors. The project integrates KNRm robotic controllers with LabVIEW to achieve accurate trajectory tracking and collision prevention in dynamic environments.

Key features include:
	•	\bf{Obstacle Detection and Avoidance}: Utilized front and side ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles with real-time decision-making.
	•	\bf{Odometry-based Positioning}: Implemented algorithms to compute the robot’s position and orientation using encoder feedback, ensuring precise navigation.
	•	\bf{Dynamic Speed Adjustment}: Designed a control system to modulate speed based on proximity to obstacles and target locations, enabling efficient and accurate movement.
	•	\bf{LabVIEW Visualization}: Developed tools for real-time visualization of sensor data and robot trajectories to enhance system performance.

This project was tested in a controlled environment with predefined obstacle layouts, demonstrating reliable navigation through complex paths without collisions. The repository includes LabVIEW code, odometry algorithms, and hardware setup instructions.
