# Ultrasonic Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Robots

This repository contains the implementation of an autonomous robot navigation system with real-time obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors. The project integrates KNRm robotic controllers with LabVIEW to achieve accurate trajectory tracking and collision prevention in dynamic environments.

## Key Features
- **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance**: Utilized front and side ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles with real-time decision-making.
- **Odometry-based Positioning**: Implemented algorithms to compute the robot’s position and orientation using encoder feedback, ensuring precise navigation.
- **Dynamic Speed Adjustment**: Designed a control system to modulate speed based on proximity to obstacles and target locations, enabling efficient and accurate movement.
- **LabVIEW Visualization**: Developed tools for real-time visualization of sensor data and robot trajectories to enhance system performance.

## Testing and Results
This project was tested in a controlled environment with predefined obstacle layouts, demonstrating reliable navigation through complex paths without collisions. The system successfully showcased:
- Accurate obstacle detection and avoidance.
- Smooth and efficient trajectory adjustments.
- Robust navigation performance under dynamic conditions.

## Repository Content
- **LabVIEW Code**: Includes control and visualization modules for real-time navigation.
